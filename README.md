# SmartSpend
This project helps a user choose the best e-commerce platform for purchasing a given product based on their personal preferences.

The user enters weights for different criteria (like price, delivery charge, discount, delivery time, rating, return policy), and the optimization model selects the platform that best fits the user’s priorities.

Optimization is performed using Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) implemented with Python + PuLP.
